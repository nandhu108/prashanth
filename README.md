# Prashanth Hospitals — Fertility & Gynaecology Event Management Platform

A complete digital platform for running Fertility & Gynaecology events: a premium
public microsite, registration and ticketing, payments, WhatsApp delivery,
event-day QR check-in, and an admin dashboard.

This repository was delivered **module by module**, all 15 tracked in
[`docs/BUILD-CHECKLIST.md`](docs/BUILD-CHECKLIST.md) with what was built and
how each was actually verified (not just "it returns 200" — real registrations,
real payments-flow testing, real screenshots).

---

## Delivered so far

**Public microsite** (`frontend-public`) — branded hero with a live countdown,
speakers, agenda, sponsors, FAQ, SEO/JSON-LD, WhatsApp-first sharing, and the
full attendee journey: pick a pass → register → pay (Razorpay) → get a QR
ticket + PDF → check in on event day → leave feedback → download a
certificate once the event concludes.

**Admin dashboard** (`frontend-admin`) — a separate app, same design system,
behind JWT auth with three roles (`superadmin`/`manager`/`checkin_staff`
enforced server-side, not just hidden nav): Event CMS, ticket types, promo
codes, registrations, a read-only payments ledger, a camera-based check-in
scanner, live stats + charts, CSV export, feedback, user management and an
audit log of every admin action.

**Backend** (`backend`) — Express 4 API, one `{success,data}` envelope,
MongoDB/Mongoose, Razorpay + Meta WhatsApp Cloud API integrations that both
degrade gracefully (clear "not configured" messaging, never a crash) until
real credentials are supplied, and a 98-check verification suite
(`backend/tests/verify.js`) that needs no live database.

**Docker** is the standard way to run all of it — `mongo`, `api`, `web`
(public site) and `admin` in one `docker-compose.yml`, the same file used
locally and in production (see [`docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md)).

| Layer      | Technology                             |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Frontend   | React 18, Vite, React Router           |
| Backend    | Node.js 18+, Express 4                 |
| Database   | MongoDB 7 (Mongoose 8)                 |
| Web server | NGINX (reverse proxy + static SPA)     |
| Styling    | CSS custom properties, no UI framework |

## Quick start



### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18 or newer
- MongoDB 7 running locally (or a connection string)



### 1. Backend

```bash
cd backend
cp .env.example .env          # edit MONGODB_URI if needed
npm install
npm run seed                  # loads the sample summit + 5 pass types
npm run dev                   # http://localhost:5000
```

Check it: `curl http://localhost:5000/api/v1/health`

### 2. Microsite

```bash
cd frontend-public
cp .env.example .env
npm install
npm run dev                   # http://localhost:5173
```

The dev server proxies `/api` to `localhost:5000`, so no CORS setup is needed.

Open **[http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)** — the seeded summit loads at the root, and also at
`/events/fertility-gynaecology-summit-2026`.

### No MongoDB yet?

Front-end work does not need a database:

```bash
cd backend && npm run mock    # serves the real seed payload on :5000
```



### Docker

The standard way to run the whole platform — mongo, api, the public
microsite and the admin dashboard — in one command:

```bash
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
docker compose up --build -d
docker compose exec api npm run seed          # sample event + 5 passes
docker compose exec api npm run seed:admin    # bootstraps the first superadmin

# microsite: http://localhost:8080
# admin:     http://localhost:8082  (login with ADMIN_BOOTSTRAP_EMAIL/PASSWORD from backend/.env)
# API:       http://localhost:8080/api/v1/health
```

Payments (Razorpay) and WhatsApp sends stay dev-safe with no configuration —
add real test-mode keys to `backend/.env` to turn them on. See
[`docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md) for the production setup
(TLS, backups, CI).

---



## Verifying the build

```bash
cd backend && npm run verify
```

Runs 98 checks across every module's models, serializers, auth/RBAC guards,
payment signature math, QR/CSV utilities and HTTP layer — including that
internal inventory counts and non-public passes never reach the browser.
No database required.

```bash
cd frontend-public && npm run build
cd frontend-admin && npm run build
```
